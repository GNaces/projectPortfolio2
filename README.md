# Card Betting Game

Card Betting Game is a basic game in which the user selects a card to play against a randomly selected computer card. While the user can choose the card, the computer randomly selects one, canceling any hand tricks used in the actual game and ensuring a fair deal each time.

Users can use the game to hone their competitive skills in their spare time. This ensures that the user remains present while resting.
